# SaneSwift

Welcome travelers!

After years working on [Backlit](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/backlit/id1203029238?), I have extracted all the code related to SANE builds and Swift wrapper to its own repository.

> [!NOTE]
> Commits before May 2024 are from the [Backlit repository](https://github.com/dvkch/Backlit), hence the sometimes misleading commit messages.
